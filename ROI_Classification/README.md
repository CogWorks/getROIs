# getROIs
Turns Cogworks/gazetools gaze data and game data (currently only implemented for Meta-TWO) into ROI-classified gaze data.

- There are two directories:
	- gazeTools_Classification : Contains sample R code anyone can use to run gazetools on some gaze data and produce classified csv output
	- ROI_Classification : Takes Gazetools output and game data along with a couple of other things to generate clissification
- Head on to each directory for Readme corresponding to each of them.
