# getROIs
Turns Cogworks/gazetools gaze data and game data into ROI-classified gaze data. More modules can be added to code base to support different gaze and game files.
- currentl code only supports Meta-TWO.

- There are two directories:
	- gazeTools_Classification : Contains sample R code anyone can use to run gazetools on some gaze data and produce classified csv output
	- ROI_Classification : Takes Gazetools output and game data along with a couple of other things to generate clissification
- Head on to each directory for Readme corresponding to each of them.
